A corporation is trying to understand eating habits in different european countries and, given that they donâ€™t have any team abl to do data analysis, they are asking our group for help.

The global dataset has been segmented into countries (in our case was USA). The corporation is looking forward to meeting with us in a final presentation, and get insights that help them start outlining a plan to make european citizens healthier and let them live longer than 100 years.

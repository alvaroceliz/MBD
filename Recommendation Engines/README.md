# Recommendation Engines

The objective of the practice is to get familiar with R package recommendarLab.

## Introduction

The problem of creating recommendations given a large database from directly elicited ratings (e.g., ratings of 1 through 5 stars) is a popular research area. RecommenderLab is a Râ€™s package which implements recommender algorithms, provides well known datasets, and facilitates research on recommender systems by providing a common development and evaluation environment. The Package provides basic algorithms and allows the user to develop and use his/her own algorithms in the framework via a simple registration procedure.

In this lab I learned how to setup the Google Collab environment to use R language, install recommenderlab package and performing a data exploratory analysis on certain datasets included within the recommenderlab package.

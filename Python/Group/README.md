# Python

The objective is to deliver a "lecture" of CLEANING DATA and DEVELOPING 2 MODELS using the dataset about RBA in Python. 

The most important parts are:

- A quick explanation of each library used, what it is for, who created and a little bit of its history.
- A quick Exploratory Data Analysis of the data set used.
- Using the EDA, explain the problems of data quality in the data set.
- Research about data preparation with Python. Propose and implement ways to clean, input missing and prepare the data for modeling.
- Develop one Regression model using rbaValue as target variable.
- Develop one binary Classification model using Risk_Description setting Risk_Description = Low as 0 and else 1 (Medium or High).

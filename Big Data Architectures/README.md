# Big Data Architectures

The goal of the assignment is to practice with Apache Hive. Firstly, I need to ingest some relevant tweets about Covid'19 in real time and then, perform some analytics on them.

On the other hand, the professor provide us with a dataset called "sentiment-dictionary" about all the english words and their sentiment polarity. The objective is to categorize the tweets that I obtain into positive, negative or neutral.
